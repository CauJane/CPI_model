# CPI_model
The dataset was developed through field surveys covering 1181 respondents and 12 crop systems and order-dependent relationship quantitation of crop-specific pesticide usage patterns, combined with multi-objective optimization to minimize provincial-level prediction errors, with official statistics serving as constraint conditions. This approach integrated crop-specific application trends, registration timelines to obtain parameter set using for spatial disaggregation to produce AI-specific input estimates at 5-arcmin resolution (2001-2022).

Notably, data processing procedures were conducted by using a general- purpose numerical optimizer on a conventional multi-core workstation.

## The original data is stored in the folder `./data/`:
* `1_pesticide_input_data_VMP_mode.xlsx` contains application rates of differ pesticides under the vehicle-mounted pump mode, compiled from farmer survey data.
* `2_pesticide_input_data_knapsack_mode.xlsx` contains application rates of differ pesticides under the knapsack mode, compiled from farmer survey data.
* `3_forbidden_pesticides.xlsx` contains application rates of differ forbidden pesticides.
* `4_pesticide_lists_for_temporal_trends_quantitation.xlsx` contains data on application rates, registration and forbidden years for all currently known pesticides.

## The original intermediate data
* The folder `./data_annual/` contains XLSX files recording the estimated pesticide usage for 12 crops from 2001 to 2022, as calculated by the temporal trends fitting models of application rates of pesticides.
* The folder `./data_adjust/` contains XLSX files recording the statistics from annual yearbook (tonnes), the usage of benchmark component and harvested area of ​​12 crops in 31 provinces of China from 2001 to 2022.

## R codes:
* `lmFitted.R` is divided into three parts. The first part fits the annual variation curves of application rates for per pesticide types (Insecticides, Fungicides or Herbicides) and per spraying patterns (vehicle-mounted pump or knapsack), based on the `1_pesticide_input_data_VMP_mode.xlsx` and `2_pesticide_input_data_knapsack_mode.xlsx` tables. The second part fits the trend of application rates for forbidden pesticides based on the `3_forbidden_pesticides.xlsx` table. The third part uses those fitted models constructed in the first two parts to estimate the application rates of all known pesticides from 2001 to 2022, based on the `4_pesticide_lists_for_temporal_trends_quantitation.xlsx` table.
* `parasEstimate.R` demonstrates how to construct the Computational Pesticide Input (CPI) model based on the XLSX files of `./data_annual/`.
* `modelAdjust.R` is applied to adjust the constructed model generated by `parasEstimate.R` based on the XLSX files of `./data_adjust/`.
